# Let's Go Home - Unity

2D puzzle platformer game built during GGJ 2019 at Central Florida.

I made this game with a friend developer in Unity. I worked on the first character (orange kid) and he worked on the second one (blue brother.)
The game concept was that, after some natural disaster, the two brothers got lost in the woods and together they had to find their way back home.

Assets were downloaded from the Unity Assets Store.
